The article presents an analysis of vehicle registrations and fuel sales data in Canada between 2017 and 2021, with a focus on the rise of electric vehicle (EV) sales and their potential impact on gasoline and diesel sales. The data shows that EV sales have steadily increased over the years, while gasoline and diesel sales have remained relatively stable. However, there was a dramatic spike in diesel prices in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The author suggests that these findings indicate that the rise of EV sales may not be directly proportional to increases in gasoline and diesel prices in Canada.
