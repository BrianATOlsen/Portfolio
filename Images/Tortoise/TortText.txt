This program is a simulation of the famous race between the Tortoise and the Hare. It is built using JavaFX and consists of four classes: Animal, Hare, Tortoise, and FXMLController. The Animal class is an abstract class that serves as the superclass for both Hare and Tortoise. The Hare and Tortoise classes extend the Animal class and contain specific implementations for each animal's movement and victory conditions.

The FXMLController class is the controller for the JavaFX GUI and handles the logic for starting the race. The GUI consists of two text areas to display the progress of the animals and four image views: two for the sprites of the animals and two to display which animal has won the race. The Final class is the main class and launches the JavaFX application.

When the program is run, the StartRace() method in the FXMLController class is called, which creates instances of the Hare and Tortoise classes and starts their threads. The threads update the progress of the animals, display the progress in the text areas, move the animal sprites, and set the winner image when one of the animals wins the race. The program also includes a custom background image for the GUI.
